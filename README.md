# ODS-Praktikum-Big-Brother
Repository for the Group Project "Big Brother" at TU Berlin  
The comments, code and documentation is written in english. We only use german
if there isn't any other way.

# Get Started

## Get project
1) Setup ssh-key.
2) Clone repository into your local folder (`git clone <ssh-url>`)

## Check for changes in your cloned or existing Project 
1) check for any changes (`git status`)
2) pull changes to your local repository (`git pull`)

## Making changes
1) add all files (`git add .`) add specific file (`git add <filename.xy>`)
2) commit changes and add a comment (`git commit -m "I changed xyz"`)
3) push it to github (`git push`) If its the first push try: 
(`git push -u origin master`)

# Project working structure
- Every team works on a branch
- Respective team-leaders decide when to merge those branches and resolve 
the conflicts

# Documentation
We have a documentation in the [doc](doc/)-folder. You can find some
information that help you understand the code better in the documentation.

# Organizational structure
We divided our group into teams that have various tasks. Each team has exactly
one supervisor who is responsible for 
- organizing/assign tasks,
- checking the validity of the API,
- document API for other teams to better understand,
- merge branches
- hold milestone talks.
- (might implement some small features or bug fixes)
If needed the supervisor is also in charge of dividing the team into sub teams.

Important issues are only discussed with the least amount of people who are 
required for the meeting (e.g. one representative of each team, subgroup, ...). 
This makes sure that meetings that are synchronous meetings are 
- more easily scheduable, 
- short (not too many people not understanding an issue) and 
- clear.

# Contribution guidelines
## Coding conventions
We use the standard conventions for python. So before you start you should
read:
1. [pep20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/): Short general principles of
the coding style.
2. [pep8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/): This is a style guide for 
python. That puts more specific rules and suggestions in place for python
coding. I heavily suggest you to program after those recommendations.
3. [pep257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/): Those are docstring 
conventions. This is required for those who will write the documentation
for the interface (so essentially the team/subgroup supervisors), but 
optional for everyone else.
4. [pep3107](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/): This talks about adding
meta information for the functions. This is required for those who will write 
the documentation for the interface (so essentially the team/subgroup 
supervisors), but optional for everyone else.

## Branching
Troughout the project the main branch should always be deployable. Therefore
it's not allowed to push to the main branch. If you want a branch to be merged,
tell your supervisor. They will make sure that the changes are properly 
reviewed and then merge the branch into main. If a supervisor assigns a task
to you then it should be somehow indicated either which branch should be used
or the branch is already created. 

Supervisors should make sure that code that
gets modified for an issue (at the same time) has a minimal amount of 
collision. This makes merging less painful.

__Note__: Unfortunately I couldn't setup the protection of the main branch 
or rather it's enforcement. Otherwise we would need to go public or upgrade our 
organization subscription. Since we might store sensitive information in our
repository or database (and might not be aware of some security threads) 
we wouldn't others to access the code.
