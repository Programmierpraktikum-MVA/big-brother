# Educational Video Training

## Motivation & Overview

The concept of the project is to greatly facilitate the learning process by effectively extracting information to be later presented in an optimal and accessible form to the student. The solution will make learning new material less overwhelming and more effective - students will be able to benefit more.

- Step 1: Students will know in advance what content the selected recording contains - they will be able to prepare better and it will not be a surprise to them.
- Step 2: Then they can watch the videos attentively, purposefully.
- Step 3: After the studies have had a look at the relevant section, they can try to get a few steps further in the task. Back-and-forth between theory and practice, so learning is efficient and stress-free.

## Ideas:
- *A way to produce tutorial videos and lecture videos.*
- *Take recordings autoregressively guess what is said afterwards.*
- *Identify segments in audio and group them together or index them with keywords so that you can access relevant segments by demand.*
- *Video to text but from text to video: if we could get to relevant sections using natural language (or diagrams).*
- *Remember topic changes from sound and image.*

# Workflow
**Description:** the user uploads a video (e.g. with a presentation) in .mp4 format. The program converts the file to a .wav format. Next, speech recognition is performed to obtain a transcription from the uploaded video. Then, the transcription is properly prepared (the processes have been described) to obtain the context, on the basis of which answers to the questions asked by the user are found. Additionally for the given answer, timestamps are returned. They indicate to a moment in video where displayed aswer is included.
